Hangman Game
Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game developed by my school group as part of our collaborative project. 
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project showcases our ability to work together and apply our knowledge of web development to create a fun and interactive game. 
The game challenges users to guess a hidden word by selecting letters, with a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.

Features:
Word selection: The game selects a random word from a predefined list.
Interactive gameplay: Players guess letters to uncover the word.
Real-time feedback: The game updates the word, the guessed letters, and the hangman figure after each guess.
Game over screen: Displays when the user either wins or loses, showing the correct word.

This project allowed us to apply JavaScript logic for handling game mechanics, such as counting guesses and displaying feedback, 
while working together as a team to design a polished and engaging user interface using HTML and CSS.
